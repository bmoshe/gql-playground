# Getting Started with the GQL Playground Project

* Run `npm i` to install dependencies
* Run `npx nx serve --project=my-server` to spin up the GraphQL server
  > GraphQL Playground should now be available at http://localhost:3333/graphql
* Run `npx graphql-codegen --watch` in order generate GQL client code.
* Run `npx nx serve --project=my-client`
  > React sample project should be available at http://localhost:4200/

# Setup for Server-Side GraphQL Code-First API

Mainly, all we need to do is inject the `GraphQLModule` (e.g., `app.module.ts` as reference).
It will auto-generate GraphQL schema based on resolvers it detects.

The way the resolver detection is working is us annotating resolvers with `@Resolver` tag (e.g., `person.resolver.ts` as reference).
In order to define the various types we use, we annotate our models with `@ObjectType` tag (e.g., `person.model.ts` as reference).

We then start the service and voil√† - GraphQL is up and running, serving our resolver!

# Setup for Client-Side GraphQL Codegen

The file `codegen.yml` contains the configuration for the `graphql-codegen` tool.

It's currently configured to consume schema from the `my-server` project,
look for `gql`-tagged queries in `*.graphql.ts` files (e.g., `person-box.graphql.ts` as reference) and
generate client code that resides at `apps/my-client/gen/graphql`.

Please refer to `person-box.graphql.ts` as the reference for a `gql`-tagged query (the client-side input) and refer to `person-box.tsx` as a reference for how to consume the autogenerated code (e.g., `useGetPersonQuery`).
